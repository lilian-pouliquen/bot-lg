## 1. What is bot-lg

bot-lg is a Discord bot giving access to helpful commands, making Game Master's life easier during a Werewolf game on Discord.  

***DISCLAIMER:*** Some commands and the messages sent by bot-lg are in French. I will work later on a translation support.

## 2. Prerequisite

### 2.1. For your Discord server

1. [Create a Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. In the OAuth2 tab:
   1. Select the "bot" scope
   2. Select the following bot permissions:
      - Manage Roles
      - View Channels
      - Send Messages
      - Embed Links
      - Read Message History
      - Mention Everyone
      - Mute Members
      - Deafen Members
      - Move Members
3. Add your new bot to your Discord server using the generated link

Note: Please, be sure to keep your bot token to fill the app/config.json file later.

### 2.2. For Docker application run

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 2.3. Optionnal

If you are a make user, a Makefile is available!  
Intall the `make` command.

## 3. Install bot-lg

1. Clone or download bot-lg project from [github](https://github.com/lilian-pouliquen/bot-lg)
2. Create the required configuration files in the project using the following \*.dist.\* files:
   - `.dist.env                             =>    .env`
   - `app/config.dist.json                  =>    app/config.json`
   - `app/commands/cmd_config.dist.json     =>    app/commands/cmd_config.json`
